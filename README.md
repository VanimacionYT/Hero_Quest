# Hero Quest

## Academy project developed in Python, using Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as IDE, which I will update with everything I learn and can be applied.

This project/game is my first serius in depth game made in python following the instructions and information that I gather from my Python academy [Tokio School](https://www.tokioschool.com).
As of now it includes:
* A rough *main menu* with 2 options using *while and if* commands.
* A *virtual dice system* using "random" library.
* A *character system* using objects, clases, getters, setters.
* A Log system that captures the events and registers characters informarion and game results in 2 diferent text files using *file management*
* A *time event capturer* using the library "datetime". Working on implementing *Time zone management* and features with "pytz"

# Python Version 
As of right now using python version **3.12.0**

# Dependencies
As of now using the following libraries:
* Random
* Datetime
* Locale
* Pytz (unused for now but planing to use. Required to install to avoid compilation errors.) [Link](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

  Pip instalation ```pip install pytz```

  Tarball ```python setup.py install```
* Time [Link](https://pypi.org/project/TIME-python/#:~:text=Installing%20%26%20importing&text=The%20TIME%20package%20is%20available,date%20with%20the%20latest%20changes.&text=To%20upgrade%20the%20current%20version,install%20TIME-python%20--upgrade%20.&text=All%20available%20versions%20are%20listed%20in%20PyPI.)

  Pip instalation ```pip install TIME-python```

## What does this project contain?

This project contains inside the SRC folder the key files for the program to work

Also the Log folder is the one where the logs are stores, such as:
* LogPartidas.txt is the file where the log of every game is saved.
* LogPersonajes.txt is the file where the log of every game is saved.
